# React & TypeScript: Add to Cart Functionality

## Overview
This is a simple e-commerce product listing app built with **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. It fetches products from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and allows users to add items to a cart. The cart count updates dynamically, and users can view their selected products in a modal.

## Features
- Fetches product data from an API and displays them in a grid layout.
- Users can add products to the cart.
- Quantity updates dynamically for products already in the cart.
- Cart icon displays the total number of items.
- Modal popup shows all cart items.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
